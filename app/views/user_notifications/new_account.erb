What is Lowdown?
  We help keep your software project on track. 
  Developers, designers, project managers and owners can all work 
  together using a common language, so everyone stays on the same page.
  
How does Lowdown help your team make better software?
  * As your team collaborates on features, those plain language features 
  turn into tests for your applications using Cucumber that verify that
  your software does what it's supposed to do.  
  * Feature estimates give you an idea of the cost of a feature so you
  can make business decisions with more information.
  * Milestones let you prioritize the feature sets in any order you want.
